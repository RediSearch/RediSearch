/**
 * RLookup Key
 *
 * A lookup key is a structure which contains an array index at which the
 * data may be reliably located. This avoids needless string comparisons by
 * using quick objects rather than "dynamic" string comparison mechanisms.
 *
 * The basic workflow is that users of a given key (i.e. "foo") are expected
 * to first create the key by use of RLookup_GetKey(). This will provide
 * the consumer with an opaque object that is the slot of "foo". Once the
 * key is provided, it may then be use to both read and write the key.
 *
 * Using a pre-defined key also allows the query to maintain a central registry
 * of used names. If a user makes a typo in a query, this registry will easily
 * detect that the name was not used previously.
 *
 * Note that the same name can be registered twice, in which case it will simply
 * increment the reference to the same key.
 *
 * There are two arrays which are accessed to check for the key. Their use is
 * mutually exclusive per-key, though multiple keys may exist which can access
 * either one or the other array. The first array is the "sorting vector" for
 * a given document. The F_SVSRC flag is set on keys which are expected to be
 * found within the sorting vector.
 *
 * The second array is a "dynamic" array within a given result's row data.
 * This is used for data generated on the fly, or for data not stored within
 * the sorting vector.
 *
 * It is possible to use the same name in both the sorting vector, and also in
 * the dynamic array. To accomplish this, create a key with the F_OUTPUT flag
 * set. This flag forces the lookup mechanism to ignore the presence of the
 * sorting vector, so that they are essentially different keys, even though
 * they have the same name.
