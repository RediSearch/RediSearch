/** Concurrent Search Exection Context.
 *
 * We allow queries to run concurrently, each running on its own thread, locking the redis GIL
 * for a bit, releasing it, and letting others run as well.
 *
 * The queries do not really run in parallel, but one at a time, competing over the global lock.
 * This does not speed processing - in fact it can actually slow it down. But it prevents a
 * common situation, where very slow queries block the entire redis instance for a long time.
 *
 * We intend to switch this model to a single thread running multiple "coroutines", but for now
 * this naive implementation is good enough and will fix the search concurrency issue.
 *
 * The ConcurrentSearchCtx is part of a query, and the query calls the CONCURRENT_CTX_TICK macro
 * for every "cycle" - meaning a processed search result. The concurrency engine will switch
 * execution to another query when the current thread has spent enough time working.
 *
 * The current switch threshold is 200 microseconds. Since measuring time is slow in itself (~50ns)
 * we sample the elapsed time every 20 "cycles" of the query processor.
 *
