 * Threading/Concurrency behavior
 *
 * Any manipulation of the cursor list happens with the GIL locked. Sequence
 * is as follows:
 *
 * (1) New cursor is allocated -- happens from main thread. New cursor is
 *     allocated and is passed to query execution thread. The cursor is not
 *     placed inside the cursor list yet, but the total count is incremented
 *
 * (2) If the cursor has results, the GIL is locked and the cursor is placed
 *     inside the idle list.
 *
 * (3) When the cursor is subsequently accessed, it is again removed from the
 *     idle list.
 *
 * (4) When the cursor is finally exhausted (or removed), it is removed from
 *     the idle list and freed.
 *
 * In essence, whenever the cursor is accessed by any internal API (i.e. not
 * a network API) it becomes invisible to the cursor subsystem, so there is
 * never any worry that the cursor is accessed from different threads, or
 * that a client might accidentally refer to the same cursor twice.
