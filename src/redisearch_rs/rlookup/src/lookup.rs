/// RLookup Key
///
/// A lookup key is a structure which contains an array index at which the
/// data may be reliably located. This avoids needless string comparisons by
/// using quick objects rather than "dynamic" string comparison mechanisms.
///
/// The basic workflow is that users of a given key (i.e. "foo") are expected
/// to first create the key by use of RLookup_GetKey(). This will provide
/// the consumer with an opaque object that is the slot of "foo". Once the
/// key is provided, it may then be use to both read and write the key.
///
/// Using a pre-defined key also allows the query to maintain a central registry
/// of used names. If a user makes a typo in a query, this registry will easily
/// detect that the name was not used previously.
///
/// Note that the same name can be registered twice, in which case it will simply
/// increment the reference to the same key.
///
/// There are two arrays which are accessed to check for the key. Their use is
/// mutually exclusive per-key, though multiple keys may exist which can access
/// either one or the other array. The first array is the "sorting vector" for
/// a given document. The F_SVSRC flag is set on keys which are expected to be
/// found within the sorting vector.
///
/// The second array is a "dynamic" array within a given result's row data.
/// This is used for data generated on the fly, or for data not stored within
/// the sorting vector.
