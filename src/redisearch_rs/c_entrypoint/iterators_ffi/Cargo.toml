# This crate has no Rust unit tests—it only contains bindings
# that will be exercises by the C side.
# If `test` is set to `true` (the default), Rust will try to generate and
# compile a "no-op" test binary, which will in turn try to link to the Redis
# allocator, thus causing a panic since it's not available.
# We sidestep the issue by disabling the unit test harness explicitly.
