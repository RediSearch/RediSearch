/// A cursor over a single score-ordered batch of `(doc_id, score)` pairs.
///
/// Batches are produced by [`ScoreSource::next_batch`] and consumed by the
/// [`TopKIterator`]'s intersection engine.  Doc IDs within a batch must be
/// **strictly increasing**.

// ── ScoreSource ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// The score-producing half of a [`TopKIterator`].
///
/// A [`ScoreSource`] knows how to:
/// 1. Produce score-ordered batches ([`next_batch`]).
/// 2. Look up the score for an individual document ([`lookup_score`]), used in Adhoc-BF mode.
/// 3. Build the final [`RSIndexResult`] for a `(doc_id, score)` pair ([`build_result`]).
/// 4. Decide, after each batch or adhoc step, whether to continue or switch strategy
///    ([`collection_strategy`]).
