//! `redisearch_rs` is the entrypoint for all the modules, on the C side, who need to consume functionality
//! that's implemented in Rust.
//!
//! It exposes an FFI module for each workspace crate that must be consumed (directly) by the C code.
// The feature flag is needed to disable this module when linking `redisearch_rs.a` against the C code,
// since including it would cause a conflict between `deps/triemap.c` and the symbols defined
// in the `trie` moduleâ€”they satisfy the same header file, `deps/triemap.h`.
// We will enable it unconditionally once `deps/triemap.c` is removed in favour of the `trie` module.
