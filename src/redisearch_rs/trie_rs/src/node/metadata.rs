/// [`Node`] is a custom dynamically-sized type (DST)â€”a type whose size and
/// alignment can't be determined at compile-time.
///
/// # Our goals
///
/// Our goal is to be as fast as possible while minimizing memory usage.
///
/// All the data associated with a node is stored, inline, within a single
/// allocated buffer.
/// This strategy allows us to:
///
/// - Minimize pointer indirection when performing operations on the node.
/// - Minimize the amount of memory spent on "metadata". E.g. we would need
///   to store a pointer to the label, a pointer to the children, and a pointer to
///   the array of first bytes.
///
/// It comes at the cost of increased complexity (see later section) as well as
/// increased number of allocations/reallocations (since we don't have spare capacity).
/// Benchmarks have shown that the performance penalty of this strategy
/// is within reasonable bounds.
///
/// # Why do we need to manage our own layout?
///
/// If we tried to define [`Node`] as a "normal" Rust struct, it'd look like this:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct Node<Data> {
///     label_len: u16,
///     n_children: u8,
///     label: [u8; self.label_len],
///     children_first_bytes: [u8; self.n_children],
///     children: [NonNull<std::ffi::c_void>; self.n_children],
///     data: Option<Data>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Unfortunately, the Rust compiler can't reason about it since the length of those
/// arrays is only known at runtime. We could try downgrading to slices:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct Node<Data> {
///     label_len: u16,
///     n_children: u8,
///     label: [u8],
///     children_first_bytes: [u8],
///     children: [NonNull<std::ffi::c_void>],
///     data: Option<Data>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// but it wouldn't be enough. The Rust compiler wants to know the _offset_ of
/// each field at compile-time, and that's only possible if you have at most one
/// dynamically-sized field and it occurs last.
///
/// Unfortunately, our [`Node`] contains _multiple_ fields whose size is not known at
/// compile-time: the label, the first bytes of children, and the children pointers.
///
/// So, here we are, forced to manage our memory layout manually!
///
/// # Fields ordering
///
/// The field order has been carefully chosen to minimize the amount of padding required
/// to align our type.
///
/// We have optimized, in particular, for `Data=NonNull<*mut c_void>`, the scenario we have in
/// [`crate::ffi`]. In that case, padding is minimal: `(2 + 1 + label_len + n_children) % 8`,
/// located between the end of the array of children first bytes and the start of the
/// array of children pointers.
///
/// # Terminology
///
/// This struct is named `PtrMetadata` since it plays the same role of
/// [`Pointee::Metadata`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/trait.Pointee.html),
/// an unstable feature to streamline custom DSTs.
