# `unsafe` pushes on you, the developer, the responsibility
# to uphold invariants that the compiler cannot verify via static analysis.
# We therefore require documentation in two locations:
# - When defining `unsafe` functions, we must document what preconditions
#   must be met to use the function safely (i.e. without causing undefined behavior)
#   This is caught by the `clippy::missing_safety_doc` lint, which is `warn`
#   by default.
# - When invoking `unsafe` functions, we must document why the preconditions
#   are met. This is caught by the `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks` lint,
#   which is `allow` by default and we're raising to `warn` here.
# Without this documentation it is significantly harder to reason about the
# safety of the code.
undocumented_unsafe_blocks = "warn"
# Each unsafe operation has different preconditions and postconditions.
# By wrapping each unsafe operation in its own block, we can ensure that
# each operation is used safely and that the preconditions and postconditions
# are met.
# We can also more easily track the amount of unsafe operations throughout
# the codebase.
