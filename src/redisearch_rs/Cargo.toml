# `unsafe` pushes on you, the developer, the responsibility
# to uphold invariants that the compiler cannot verify via static analysis.
# We therefore require documentation in two locations:
# - When defining `unsafe` functions, we must document what preconditions
#   must be met to use the function safely (i.e. without causing undefined behavior)
# - When invoking `unsafe` functions, we must document why the preconditions
#   are met.
# Without this documentation it is significantly harder to reason about the
# safety of the code.
undocumented_unsafe_blocks = "warn"
# Each unsafe operation has different preconditions and postconditions.
# By wrapping each unsafe operation in its own block, we can ensure that
# each operation is used safely and that the preconditions and postconditions
# are met.
# We can also more easily track the amount of unsafe operations throughout
# the codebase.
