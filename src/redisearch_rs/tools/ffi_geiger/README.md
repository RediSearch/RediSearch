# FFI Geiger

Static analysis tool that counts FFI (C function) calls across the Rust codebase.
It reports which C functions are called, how often, and from which crates.

## Usage

```bash
cd src/redisearch_rs && cargo ffi-geiger
```

The project must be built first so that the `bindings.rs` file
generated by `bindgen` exists in the target directory.

## What it excludes

- `c_entrypoint/` crates
- `tools/` crates
- Bencher crates (`*_bencher`)
- Test utility crates (`*_test_utils`)
- `tests/` directories and `#[cfg(test)]` / `#[test]` code

## Output

A markdown-formatted report with:
- A per-crate table of FFI symbols and their call counts, sorted by total calls descending.
- A summary line with total calls and unique symbols across all crates.
