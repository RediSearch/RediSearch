/// A normalized string type that ensures the inner string is in lower-case and utf case-folded, e.g. 'ÃŸ' becomes 'ss'.
///
/// Internally it uses the `icu_casemap` library to perform case folding, which is a Unicode-aware way of normalizing strings for comparison.
/// That is a big change from using `libnu` in C to the Rust implementation, which will be tackled in the future.
/// Read the remark section for more details.
///
/// The method [`NormalizedString::new_unchecked`] is used to create an instance by assuming the input is
/// already normalized. We use that for the FFI glue and depend on libnu for now.
///
/// ## Remarks on icu_casemap and libnu
///
/// The C code is using the function `normalizeStr` to normalize strings (utf case-folding). This functionality depends on `libnu`.
/// The `icu_casemap` crate is a Rust implementation that provides `similar`` functionality, allowing us to perform Unicode-aware case folding.
/// But we need to build confidence, e.g. with property tests, that `similar` is `same` to `libnu` in here.
/// See [Jira Ticket MOD-10320](https://redislabs.atlassian.net/browse/MOD-10320)
///
/// Miri complains about the `icu_casemap` crate because of stacked borrows. Probably a false positive, due to un-released safety models.
/// We raised a discussion in the ICU4X project to address this [issue #6723](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x/issues/6723),
/// as it affects our ability to use `icu_casemap` in Miri tests.
///
/// The ICU is aware of this issue and discussing current workarounds.
