//! Wildcard matching functionality, as specified in the

//!
//! All functionality is provided through the [`WildcardPattern`] struct.
//! You can create a [`WildcardPattern`] from a pattern using [`WildcardPattern::parse`] and
//! then rely on [`WildcardPattern::matches`] to determine if a string matches the pattern.

    /// # Escaping
    ///
    /// The backslash, `\`, is used to escape symbols that have special meaning in the pattern.
    /// In particular, it is used to escape:
    /// - `*` (wildcard), as `br"\*"`
    /// - `?` (single character wildcard), as `br"\?"`
    /// - `\` (backslash), as `br"\\"`
    ///
    /// There is no validation on escaped charactersâ€”whatever comes after the backslash is treated as a literal.
    /// For example, `br"\a"` is parsed as `vec![Token::Literal(b"a")]`, even though it is not a valid escape sequence.
    /// This matches the behaviour of the [original C implementation](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/blob/d988bde19385cd4e6aeec7987d344819eda66ab4/src/wildcard.c#L136).
    ///
    /// If you wish to reject some of these escaped characters as illegal, you should perform an additional validation step
    /// on top of the parsing process.
    ///
    /// # Simplifications
    ///
    /// The parsing routine tries to simplify the pattern when possible:
    ///
    /// - Consecutive `*` are replaced with a single `*`. `*` matches any number of characters, including none,
    ///   therefore consecutive `*` are equivalent to a single `*`.
    /// - `*?` sequences are replaced with `?*`. `*?` matches one or more characters, just like `?*` matches zero or more characters.
    ///   But the latter allows us to group together multiple `*` characters, which can be simplified further using the previous simplification rule.
    ///   For example, `*?*?*?` becomes `???***`, which is then further simplified to `???*`.
    ///
    /// # Allocations
    ///
    /// Parsing tries to minimize allocations: literal tokens refer to slices of the original pattern.
    ///
    /// As a consequence, patterns with escaped characters may be broken into
    /// more tokens than one might expect at a first glance.
    ///
    /// Let's look at `br"f\\oo"` as an example.
    /// The obvious parsing outcome would be `vec![Token::Literal(br"f\oo")]`, where the escaped backslash is
    /// resolved to a single character (`\`).
    /// But `br"f\oo"` is not a substring of the original pattern. The parsing routine would have to allocate
    /// new memory to store the re-assembled pattern with escaped characters resolved.
    ///
    /// Instead, we split at escape points to maintain zero-copy references. `br"f\\oo"`
    /// is parsed as two tokens rather than one: `vec![Token::Literal(br"f"), Token::Literal(br"\oo")]`.
    /// Both tokens refer to slices of the original pattern and, combined, they give us the correct (resolved)
    /// pattern.
