//! Result processors transform entries retrieved from the inverted index when fulfilling
//! a user-provided query (e.g. scoring, filtering, sorting, paginating, etc.).
//!
//! Result processors form a chain, assembled by the query planner.
//! Processing is lazy: when the last processor in the chain is asked to yield a result, it
//! will in turn ask for entries from the previous processor, recursively until it reached
//! the beginning of the chain.
//! At the head of the chain, you will always find an index iterator, yielding entries from
//! the database indexes.

/// Duplicates [`ffi::ResultProcessor`] to add pinning-related safety features.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Result processors intrusively linked, where one result processor has the pointer to the
/// previous (forming an intrusively singly-linked list). This places a big safety invariant on all code
/// that touches this data structure: Result processors must *never* be moved while part of a QueryIterator
/// chain. Accidentally moving a processor will create a broken link and undefined behaviour.
///
/// This invariant is implicit in the C code where its uncommon to move the heap allocated objects (which would
/// mean memcopying them around); In Rust we need to explicitly manage this invariant however, as move semantics make
/// it easy to break accidentally. The compiler is free to move values as it sees fit (Rust calls this trivially moveable).
/// As a result a Rust reference (&T or &mut T) is a stable "handle" to a value but a pointer (*const T or *mut T) is not.
///
/// For intrusive data types like this we need to tell the compiler "don't move this please I have pointers to it" which is called
/// pinning in Rust.
///
/// We wrap a reference in the Pin<T> type (Pin<&mut T>) which disallows moving the pointee from its location in memory.
/// Crucially though, the way Pin disallows is not magic, it simply doesn't implement any methods and traits that would
/// allow a caller to move the value. Unfortunately this means banning all mutable access to the value T (you cannot get a
/// &mut T from a Pin<&mut T> for example) since with a &mut T you can always move the value very easily (via mem::replace for example).
///
/// So Rust has another technique that lets you treat memory locations a "pinned" while still being able to mutate
/// them through "pin projections" essentially a "proxy type" that behaves like a regular Rust type (including allowing
/// moving & mutation) but will forward all accesses and mutations to the backing, actually pinned type
/// (this is what the `#[pin_project]` below does!)
