/********************************************************************************
 * Result Processor Chain
 *
 * We use a chain of result processors to sort, score, filter and page the results coming from the
 * index.
 *
 * The index iterator tree is responsible for extracting results from the index, and the processor
 * chain is responsible for processing those and preparing them for the users.
 * The processors are exposing an iterator interface, adding values to SearchResult objects.
 *
 * SearchResult objects contain all the data needed for a search result - from docId and score, to
 * the actual fields loaded from redis.
 *
 * Processors can add more fields, rewrite them, change the score, etc.
 * The query plan builds the chain based on the request, and then the chain just processes the
 * results.
 *
