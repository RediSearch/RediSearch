# This file is useful for triggering actions when you implement them.
# When the `branches-ignore` line is commented out, this workflow will run on every push.
# It is better to use this file for testing your new flows than creating a new one, to avoid cluttering the repo
# action tab with unused workflows.
# Don't worry about conflicts with other PRs - there is no "right" content of this file.
# Make sure the `branches-ignore` line is not commented out when you merge your PR.

  push:
    # branches-ignore: ['**'] # ignore all branches. Comment this line to run your workflow below on every push.
