{"asin": "B00000JDFK", "description": "Nothing can improve your gaming skills like a good controller, and Logitech's Wingman Interceptor is an outstanding alternative to using the keyboard for flying the virtual skies. With more buttons than you have fingers and all the software you'll need to take proper advantage of them, this is one versatile product.We liked the build quality of the Interceptor: at over 2.5 pounds, the Interceptor is hefty, and the entire unit is tightly machined for a solid feel. Unfortunately, the stick is sculpted to conform to a right hand, so lefties are out of luck.We were impressed with the thought that went into this product after the installation. Logitech ships Wingman Profiler software, which lets users program every button. The great thing is you can establish profiles for each game installed on your system, so you don't have to reprogram the stick every time you play a different game. You can easily print, export, or import profiles as well.Technically, this stick has 33 programmable buttons, but 24 of those \"buttons\" are accounted for by the three hat switches on top of the stick. You can press each of these three hats in any of eight directions, and the software allows users to assign any command to any hat direction. The system works well when commands are assigned to the hat switches in logical groups. For example, our standard flight simulator assignment uses one hat for panning the view, one for cycling through targets, and the third for adjusting trim. In space simulations, we used the third hat for cycling through weapons.The ubiquitous trigger is present, but the Interceptor does it right by adding a separate button directly beneath the trigger. You activate this button by flicking it to the left or right, which makes it nearly impossible to set the button off inadvertently during a frantic trigger-pulling session. Another button rests directly under your thumb, with yet another nestled under your middle fingertip. These last two buttons are a little too sensitive, but serviceable--just don't assign the \"Launch Nuke\" command to either of them.The base of the unit holds four more buttons plus the throttle slider. This throttle is better than many other integrated designs we've used, as it never strays from the settings you establish. It's also relatively large, yet positioned so you won't bump it accidentally.The base is too heavy and wide to rest on your knee, so you're better off planting it on your desk. In our tests, even the most frantic dogfights didn't cause the Interceptor to budge. This is due to the Interceptor's weight and the fact that the stick is designed to provide little leverage.So how does the Interceptor feel during actual gameplay? In a word, smooth. So many joysticks on the market today are loose and jittery, requiring the skills of a surgeon to use them properly. The play in this stick is tight enough that precise, smooth movements are the norm. Lining up on targets in flight simulators is pure joy with the Interceptor, as it seems to read your mind. The only thing missing is twist action for rudder control.Pros:Extremely smooth operationPlenty of programmable buttonsProfiler software is excellentSuperb build qualityCons:Multiple hat switches can be confusingNo force feedbackNo twist action for rudder control", "title": "Logitech WingMan Interceptor 9-Button Joystick", "brand": null, "price": 29.99, "categories": ["Accessories", "Controllers", "Joysticks", "PC", "Video Games"]}
{"asin": "B00000JDG3", "description": "A behemoth of a joystick, the Logitech WingMan Force is a killer. Packed away in its nearly 5-pound mass is a network of power that gives it exceptional muscle and stability.The WingMan Force features nine programmable buttons, an eight-way hat switch, a thumb-controlled throttle, and WingMan Software, which makes programming buttons and setting preferences simple. Installing the joystick consisted of plugging in the power, connecting the USB cable, and booting up the software.The weight of the joystick certainly helped with stability. Even when games got rowdy, the WingMan stayed firmly on the desk. The grip was solid and comfortable, and we didn't experience some of the jerking and stiffness that many force-feedback sticks produce. This can be chalked up to Logitech's cable-drive system, which is smoother than many gear-based joysticks. We also appreciated that most buttons on the stick were easy to reach in the midst of a game that demanded serious concentration.We set multiple profiles within the WingMan Software for each game, and the software remembered them for future use. The force feedback on some games seemed less powerful than we expected, even with controls set to high. At one point, the force feedback gave out all together in the middle of a game, but resumed once we restarted. However, at other times, the force feedback was tremendous, making for an intense experience. We found the joystick to be best for games with machine guns or rapid-fire weapons, where the force feedback was at its best.Despite some inconsistencies, the WingMan Force is a nice joystick with a lot of power.

It's not the best-playing basketball game out there,  as it does commit some serious fouls with its questionable artificial  intelligence. But likeNFL 2Kbefore it, this is yet another  sports game that Dreamcast owners will want to show off to friends.The clean graphics show some extremely well-detailed players,  stadiums, fans, and even coaches. While the player animations  aren't quite smooth as glass (there are quite a few speed-ups and  slowdowns), the players do move in a fairly realistic manner. When you  see the instant replay of your favorite power forward delivering a  massive dunk, you'll cheer. To complement the visuals, Sega has added  play-by-play and color commentary to document the on-screen action.  While this does get a little repetitive, this feature ultimately adds  to the atmosphere of realism.NBA 2Kshows some trouble with controls. This is most apparent  in handling loose balls. You'll cringe as you occasionally watch long  passes sail out of the court, resulting in mindless turnovers. This is  especially painful to watch when the Dreamcast can't complete passes  to computer-controlled players. These stupid turnovers can, will, and  do affect a game's final score--and have even caused a few games to be  restarted in disgust. On the positive side,NBA 2Kcontains a  new finesse-based method of hitting foul shots that requires that you  squeeze the control triggers in near perfect synch.The create-a-player and coaching options make it relatively easy to  lead your team from postseason TV watchers to championship ring  owners.While the 2000 season's prettiest basketball game offers more than  just the most delicious eye candy, there is still a lingering feeling  thatNBA 2Kcould've been much better with a  little more fine-tuning. At the very least, whileNBA 2Kis recommended, it is  anticipated that the successorNBA 2K1will offer even more  backboard-breaking fun.--Mark BrooksPros:Spectacular graphics that show plenty of detailPlay-by-play and color commentary add to the funEasy to play, but different from most console roundball gamesFoul shots are a highlightCons:Graphics suffer from occasional slowdown for no apparent reasonControls could be stronger", "title": "NBA 2K", "brand": "Sega", "price": 3.98, "categories": ["Games", "More Systems", "Sega Dreamcast", "Video Games"]}

Place the gas and brake-pedal pad on the floor, and you're ready for the green flag.The control is precise and realistic, offering much better gameplay than other controllers for driving software. The nonslip rubberized wheel grip is comfortable and designed after actual racing wheels--you might even feel a twinge of resentment when handling your nonvirtual car. Six programmable buttons, four near the center (Speed Racer-style), let you shift gears, fire weapons, or do whatever else it takes to win. All are within easy reach of the thumbs, so you won't have to relax your control.Though there's no feedback to simulate the pull of actual driving conditions (as with the Logitech WingMan Formula Force), you'll still find yourself immersed in the drive. The pedal base is large and sturdy enough for long use and won't slip on most surfaces. The spring-based pedal is as easy to control as the wheel, and a quick tap on the brake won't bring you screeching to a halt. The large size of the units--12 by 14 inches for the pedals and a 10-inch diameter for the wheel--will be awkward to less-dedicated gamers or those with limited storage space for peripherals. Whether you're a little old lady who only drives on Sundays or a mad-style speed demon who eats pavement for breakfast, the Logitech WingMan Formula will give you the control you need to keep racing for hours.--Rob LightnerPros:High-precision controlRealistic feelNonslip gripCons:No feedbackLarge size", "title": "Logitech WingMan Formula", "brand": null, "price": 43.0, "categories": ["Accessories", "Controllers", "PC", "Video Games"]}

Get all the control you need with six programmable buttons and 270 degrees of rotation. Start playing right away with pre-configured button maps for hundreds of popular PC games.Tactile Feedback TechnologyTraditionally, communication via control devices has been a one-way street. You move your mouse, joystick, wheel, gamepad, etc., and that device communicates a signal to the PC or console. Communication back to you could only come from the display (PC monitor or TV) or from speakers.Tactile feedback adds technology to control devices that allows them to communicate to you as well. Today, the two primary types of tactile feedback for control devices are vibration feedback and force-feedback.About Vibration FeedbackVibration feedback works on the same principles as the vibration mode in your mobile phone or pager, but is typically much more sophisticated. It can be used to communicate specific ideas or sensations. The effects can range from a simple buzz that serves as an alert or confirmation, to a slower rhythmic motion that simulates vibrations from an approaching train, to a single, strong jolt that simulates a collision.However, vibration feedback cannot resist your movement, assist it, or provide any directional movement or information. Because they are much simpler, vibration feedback devices tend to be much less expensive than force-feedback devices.About Force FeedbackForce-feedback is a more sophisticated technology and provides people with very realistic tactile feedback. It has been widely used for some time in medical, space and flight simulators to provide lifelike training for students and professionals who make split-second decisions based not just on sight and sound, but also on their sense of touch.This cutting-edge technology has been extended to PC and next-generation console gaming over the last five years, and is now coming to the Nintendo GameCube. Force-feedback is substantially more rich, realistic and engaging than the non-directional vibration feedback to which many gamers are accustomed. Through the use of advanced software and electronics, force-feedback can move a steering wheel, joystick, or mouse as if the device were subject to real external forces.Force-feedback devices include one or more motors plus additional mechanical and electrical components and are capable of a wide variety of effects. Force-feedback can resist your movement, or assist it, and is capable of providing specific directional movement and information. And it can also provide sophisticated vibration.Logitech Profiler software for PC:Customize button functionality: Every game is different, and so is every gamer. We know that.

The Game Adapter can be used in two different ways. If you have an existing home wireless network with a cable or DSL Internet connection, the Game Adapter lets your PlayStation2, Xbox or GameCube attach to the network so you can get into online games without running wires to the game room. Or, use a pair of Game Adapters to form a \"cable-less cable\" between two game consoles for head-to-head gaming--in the same room, or all the way across the house.It's completely driver-free, so there's no software-installation hassle, and it works on any platform. And the innovative Channel Selector Button with LED display makes wireless network configuration into child's play. If you're using two Game Adapters, just press their Channel Selector Buttons until the channel numbers match, and you're connected. To connect to an existing wireless network, press the Button to select Infrastructure mode. If your setup's a little different, there's an easy-to-use PC-based Setup Wizard to guide you through.

{"asin": "B0000E5U5G", "description": "This exclusive limited-edition gold color Game Boy Advance SP comes with theSuper Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3game and a coupon for free SP headphones with adapter.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and overall, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

{"asin": "B000H683YC", "description": "If you've got anXbox 360, then you're probably very happy with the system's fantastic graphics, bountiful title selection, and sleek design. Now, what about a high-performance sound system to enhance your gaming experience?  Designed to match the style of the Xbox 360, Pioneer's HTS-GS1 5.1-Channel Surround Sound System may be just what you're looking for. After setting up this home-theater-in-a-box (HTIB) system, we sat back and enjoyed several hours of pure gaming bliss. Whether we were battling online against otherHalo 2gamers, or saving the planet in the Xbox 360 title,Prey, this system delivered awesome and inspired surround sound.Easy Set-up and ConfigurationEverything you need to set up the HTS-GS1 is included in the box. Using the handy Quick Start Guide, we had the entire system wired in less than an hour. The easy-to-follow instructions and color-coded wires made the set up of the center speaker, subwoofer, and two rear and two front speakers a cinch. One word of warning: the included wires are an adequate length for a small-to-medium sized room, but if you really want to spread out, you'll need additional wiring to complete the task. But for our purposes, the HTS-GS1 provided everything we needed to get the job done.The HTS-GS1 is an ideal choice for any small-to-medium sized space that is dedicated to Xbox 360 gaming.Once the speakers were in place, we took advantage of the system's auto MCACC microphone calibration technology. We simply placed the ultra high-end calibration microphone on the back of the couch -- directly behind our favorite gaming position -- and the HTS-GS1 automatically adjusted the sound for the distance, volume, speaker size, and equalization. Once the system calibrated the speakers to match the layout of our room, we were off to the races --literally -- tackling the toughest race tracks available onProject Gotham Racing 3.Although all the connections were easy to distinguish and connect, we do have one complaint: there are loads and loads of wires to deal with. This is not a problem unique to the HTS-GS1, but we found it a bit ironic that a home-theater-in-a-box designed to complement the Xbox 360 -- a gaming system noted for its clean design and wireless capabilities -- would be so overloaded with wires.Sleek, Xbox 360 DesignThis surround sound system offers an attractive white design, accented with gray speaker grilles, and features five small satellite speakers (center, two front, and two rear), and a large subwoofer that is about the size of a standard CPU tower. Although the subwoofer is a bit bulky, it houses all of the system's electronics and connectivity jacks. And since this theater system lacks a DVD player (the assumption is you'll use your Xbox 360 for movies), the display unit is quite small; in fact, it's not much bigger than the included remote control. It features tiny, silver control buttons and a large, circular power button. The front panel delivered all the information we needed via a scrolling single-line display. The included easy-to-use remote control is packed with features, and, like the rest of the system, it also matches the Xbox 360 design. With it we could control all of the system's features, as well as our Xbox 360 gaming console.Sound Designed for High-Performance GamingWith the HTS-GS1 we could hear every audio effect the Xbox 360 had to offer -- from the lightest wind to bone-rattling explosions. The system delivers great audio performance with a powerful 600 watts of total RMS power, and dynamic 5.1-channel surround sound with Dolby Digital/Pro Logic II and DTS decoding. In addition to playing video games, the Xbox 360 also plays DVDs and MP3 files. We took advantage of both and spent an afternoon watching movies, and an evening listening to a stack of CDs. The system responded to every form of entertainment that we could throw at it -- games, film, and music -- with crisp, clear, and powerful sound.The HTS-GS1 also features Front Stage Surround Sound, a virtual surround-sound feature. To test this function, we moved all the speakers to the front of the room. Through its sophisticated digital sound processing and directional speakers, the system can mimic surround sound without the hassle of running wires to additional rear speakers. Although the traditional surround sound set-up delivered the best audio surround sound quality, the Front Stage option was still much better than our regular, old television speakers.The HTS-GS1 can be a bit pricey when compared to other home-theater-in-a-box systems, but Pioneer's design may trump the cost for those who want an attractive, surround-sound option that matches the Xbox 360's style. And even though his system may not be the optimal home-theater system choice for a large family room, the HTS-GS1 is an ideal choice for any small-to-medium sized space that is dedicated to Xbox 360 gaming.ProsAttractive, Xbox 360 designSimple set-up and great soundIdeal for any small-to-medium sized gaming roomConsLots and lots of wiresA bit pricey when compared to similar HTIBsWhat's in the BoxReceiver/subwoofer, five satellite speakers (two front, two rear, and one center), display unit, remote control, two AA batteries, two display unit stands, AM loop antenna, FM wire antenna, display unit cable, optical cable, power cord, five speaker cables, microphone (for Auto MCACC setup), non skid pads (small and large), mounting brackets, screws, operating instructions, and warranty card.", "title": "Pioneer HTS-GS1 5.1-Channel Surround Sound System for the Xbox 360 (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "brand": null, "price": 4.45, "categories": ["Accessories", "Hardware", "More Systems", "Video Games", "Xbox"]}

{"asin": "B000UHKV9I", "description": "The SteelSeries Siberia Full-Size USB Headset was developed in co-operation with professional gamers to ensure that the soundscape, specifications and comfort is suitable for long gaming sessions. But the SteelSeries Siberia USB Full-Size Headset is also designed for multi-functionality. This headset is bundled with a USB soundcard featuring virtual 7.1 surround, extremely suitable for gaming, music and movies. Supports 3D positional. The 12-channel equalizer allows for tweaking to personal preferences, while the built-in effects processor can provide ambience and other effects.Apart from using the headset for PC gaming, this product has been designed so gamers can use it with their favorite MP3-player, handheld gaming device or practically any other kind of portable digital device. That is why the headset features a separate microphone (and a separate soundcard), so users can enjoy music on the road without having to bring unnecessary gear. The cable length has been optimized for use with MP3 players and similar products and comes with an additional extra long cable for use with stationary computers.Wasn't this headset once known as the Icemat Siberia?Yeah, it was. We launched both SteelSeries and Icemat back in 2001 and decided to consolidate products and branding in 2007. It's still the same award-winning product.What is the difference between the SteelSeries Siberia full-size headsets and the SteelSeries Siberia full-size USB headset?The USB soundcard.I have a soundcard in my computer is your USB soundcard better than what I already own?Probably not. Our tiny and affordable soundcard was never designed to out-perform the big expensive soundcards out there. It was designed for gamers who either use systems with (often crappy) on-board soundcards or players who travel a lot.Why is your USB soundcard better than my on-board soundcard?The soundcard features a processor which frees up CPU power on systems utilizing an on-board soundcard. More free CPU power equals more CPU power for your game application -- and quite possibly a better in-game performance from the player. The sound quality should be considerably better as well.Why do you recommend your USB soundcard for gamers who travel?Playing at home is one thing. Playing at LAN-parties, tournaments or even netcafes is an entirely different thing. Imagine playing on a tournament computer with a crappy on-board soundcard -- or just a soundcard which produces an entirely different soundscape than you're used too. All those hundreds of hour practicing at home, getting used to your in-game sound and all the timings and in-game decisions you base on sound, just went out the window. With our USB soundcard you play anywhere, with the same sound settings you've practiced with every day.What the difference between this headset and the H-line (5H v2, 4H and 3H) of SteelSeries headsets?We designed this headset for multi-functionality. Everything from the separate microphone to the cord length on this product was designed so you can use it both for playing games and use it with MP3-players, handheld consoles and such. And, as you might have noticed, the visual design makes a somewhat bigger statement about personality.", "title": "SteelSeries Siberia Full-Size USB Headset (White)", "brand": null, "price": 79.99, "categories": ["Accessories", "Hardware", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Video Games"]}

The cable length has been optimized for use with MP3 players and similar products and comes with an additional extra long cable for use with stationary computers.Wasn't this headset once known as the Icemat Siberia?Yeah, it was. We launched both SteelSeries and Icemat back in 2001 and decided to consolidate products and branding in 2007. It's still the same award-winning product.What is the difference between the SteelSeries Siberia full-size headsets and the SteelSeries Siberia full-size USB headset?The USB soundcard.I have a soundcard in my computer is your USB soundcard better than what I already own?Probably not. Our tiny and affordable soundcard was never designed to out-perform the big expensive soundcards out there. It was designed for gamers who either use systems with (often crappy) on-board soundcards or players who travel a lot.Why is your USB soundcard better than my on-board soundcard?The soundcard features a processor which frees up CPU power on systems utilizing an on-board soundcard. More free CPU power equals more CPU power for your game application -- and quite possibly a better in-game performance from the player. The sound quality should be considerably better as well.Why do you recommend your USB soundcard for gamers who travel?Playing at home is one thing. Playing at LAN-parties, tournaments or even netcafes is an entirely different thing. Imagine playing on a tournament computer with a crappy on-board soundcard -- or just a soundcard which produces an entirely different soundscape than you're used too. All those hundreds of hour practicing at home, getting used to your in-game sound and all the timings and in-game decisions you base on sound, just went out the window. With our USB soundcard you play anywhere, with the same sound settings you've practiced with every day.What the difference between this headset and the H-line (5H v2, 4H and 3H) of SteelSeries headsets?We designed this headset for multi-functionality. Everything from the separate microphone to the cord length on this product was designed so you can use it both for playing games and use it with MP3-players, handheld consoles and such. And, as you might have noticed, the visual design makes a somewhat bigger statement about personality.", "title": "SteelSeries Siberia Full-Size USB Headset with Soundcard (Black)", "brand": null, "price": 79.99, "categories": ["Accessories", "Hardware", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Video Games"]}

{"asin": "B000UTH19Y", "description": "The Novint Falcon is an entirely new type of game controller. Replacing your mouse or joystick, the Falcon is, essentially, a small robot that lets you experience true virtual touch unlike any controller in history.  The Novint Falcon lets you control a game in three dimensions, and also lets you feel high-fidelity three-dimensional force feedback. The Falcon controller moves right and left, forwards and backwards, like a mouse, but also moves up and down. When you hold the Falcon's detachable Grip and move your cursor to interact with a virtual object, environment, or character, motors in the device turn on and are updated approximately 1000 times a second, letting you feel texture, shape, weight, dimension, and dynamics. The Falcon lets you control and interact with games in a more realistic way, allowing you to develop real physical skill and muscle memory, adding a new dimension to gaming. The award-winning Novint Falcon makes virtual items and experiences feel real.  Feel the weight of a basketball as you shoot it towards a hoop -- the momentum and impact as you swing a virtual golf club and strike a ball -- the recoil of a weapon - or the physical characteristics of virtual objects and environments.

And the Taito's shiny black surface not only looks elegant - its slick surface also allows for perfect tracking with any mouse sensor. CONQUER MORE WITH NANO SPEED AND PRECISION - Textile mouse pads with a standard woven structure only offer effective gliding in one direction. The Taito is different: its heat-treated Nano Matrix construction delivers lightning-quick gliding on both the X and Y axis - without sacrificing any control. Plus, movement on the Y axis benefits from additional vertical stabilizing properties built into the Nano Matrix - which means up and down movement is always fast and rock steady. Up close the Nano advantage is easy to see. Each Taito provides a form fit to the playing surface, compensating for any unevenness on a gamer's desk - which means uninterrupted gliding on every surface. Players who prefer a lower mouse sensitivity - i.e., a lower dpi - will appreciate more room to move, while high-sense gamers who use upper range dpi settings will enjoy the smaller, space-saving Taito versions. PLAY WORRY FREE - The Taito's non-slip rubberized backing provides a steady grip during even the most hectic game. Even if you try moving it with your palm, the Taito won't budge. We've also ruggedized the Taito for extremely active play, giving it an exceptionally robust design built for a long gaming life. GAME WITH WHISPER-QUIET MOVEMENT - The heat-blasted Nano Matrix structure provides less friction, which means mouse movements can barely be heard.

There are four optical digital jacks. One jack is connected to the unit to which you want to add more optical jacks to (normally a digital receiver). The other three jacks are connected to the units which you want to connect to the other unit.

The granular surface combined with the integrated metal film offers unparalleled gliding characteristics. At the same time, the Sota occupies a smaller footprint on the desktop compared to standard mousepads, without restricting the gliding area in the slightest. granular SURFACE The Sota was given a granular surface inspired by the geophysical characteristics of granular matter. This gives the pad unique gliding properties which make it seem as if the mouse is almost moving by itself. Accordingly, pointer positioning is improved and aiming is optimized to such an extent that every gamer will benefit. The wrist cut-out on the lower side of the mousepad and its compact dimensions mean the gliding area is extremely comfortable - perfect for high-sense-gamers in particular. The Sota mousepad is one of the first mousepads to combine a hard granular plastic surface with an ultra-soft, flexible base. Despite that it achieves a thickness of just 3mm. It lies completely flat on the desktop and thanks to the non-slip base remains rooted to it - it also provides an additional layer of padding for comfort. The surface itself is extremely easy to clean so anything causing friction can be removed in a flash meaning the mouse is never slowed down. INTEGRATED METAL FOIL - Integrated between the hard and soft layers of the mousepad is a thin metal film. On the one hand this gives the mousepad a discreet metallic shimmer which sets this pad apart from the others in terms of looks as well. On the other hand, this film improves the tracking characteristics of the Sota - the metal film reflects the light back to optical or laser sensors without distorting it in any way thereby providing outstanding tracking and amazingly precise aiming.", "title": "ROCCAT Sota - Granular Black Gaming Mousepad (ROC-13-110)", "brand": "ROCCAT", "price": 29.89, "categories": ["Accessories", "Controllers", "Gamepads", "PC", "Video Games"]}

With a non-slip rubber back, an integrated support plate, and an innovative micro-granular surface, your ROCCAT mouse will glide over the Raivo like an eagle - super slick. Available in three kickass colors: stealth black, lightning blue and midnight black. The micro-dots on the granular Raivo surface are designed with laser precision to be extra small. The result? An impossibly smooth and slick surface that your mouse will glide over without restriction, and ultra-precise tracking that will have you take your prey down in record time. The innovative Raivo surface works a treat with both laser and optical mice. Featured in the Raivo is an integrated flex-support plate, making the mouse pad stable, durable and ideal for any desk or table. Since the plate is semi-flexible, it ensures the pad will never warp or lose its shape. At the same time, it is solid enough to sit in perfect harmony on whatever surface you put it in. The Raivo features an ingenious, Ergonomic Battle Shield Shape, so that your wrist will sit in the optimum position for avoiding muscle strain or fatigue - ideal for lengthy battles. It also perfectly complements the super slick Raivo surface, so that you can track with relative ease - not having to stress about your sleeve clashing with the mouse pad. Thanks to its grip-hard traction orbs, the rubber backing on the Raivo will ensure your mouse pad will stay exactly where you put it - and simply won't budge an inch. What does this mean?

So we gave you a blue crystal LED Backlit keyboard that has 3 levels of brightness, so your eyes can adjust comfortably. The Vicious Touch comes with a soft matte finish that feels like heaven on your fingers tips. The Vicious Touch also comes with 15 Programmable Macro Keys so you can store your favorite macros for buying and crafting equipment, activating abilities or skills, or just good old fashion trash talk.

{"asin": "B00DNVDIPM", "description": "Using a battle-proven combo of advanced gaming tech and design, our ROCCAT Scientists built the ROCCAT Sense - High Precision Gaming Mouse pad for desktop warriors who demand peak performance during intense, high-speed combat. The Sense's ultra-soft cloth construction takes advantage of a highly-calibrated blend of advanced speed, control and ergonomic features, delivering optimal gliding and comfort in a slim, stable and rugged design - a highly-tuned battle mix engineered to deliver out-of-this-world command capability. And now our engineers have updated the Sense with killer new optics designed to intimidate foes and impress allies like never before - giving serious gamers more reason than ever to come to their Senses and get down to business. To outfit commanders for rigorous combat, our ROCCAT Scientists engineered the Sense by taking an ultra-soft cloth upper structure and treating it with an advanced, friction-reducing microcrystalline coating - a combination that allows for the lightning-quick mouse movements and high level of precision needed for victorious, high-octane gaming. With a command surface of 400 x 280mm, the Sense offers plenty of room for even the most active gamer to command in bold style. It's ideal for quick and aggressive mouse jockeying on both the x- and y-axis - and its advanced coating ensures that every action is both speedy and precise. And, at a slim 2mm, the Sense offers a sleek and lightweight - yet amazingly comfortable - gaming platform. No matter how hectic the skirmish gets, the Sense stays put. That's because our ROCCAT Scientists constructed its rubberized base using a non-slip, diagonal chevron weave that grips hard to your playing surface. You won't have to worry about a temporary loss of control caused by inadvertent slippage - which means you can concentrate fully on your on-screen tactics. Plus, the Sense's malleable rubberized construction smoothest out any unevenness on your gaming surface.", "title": "ROCCAT Sense Meteor Blue 2mm High Precision Gaming Mousepad (ROC-13-104)", "brand": "ROCCAT", "price": 22.21, "categories": ["Accessories", "Controllers", "Gamepads", "PC", "Video Games"]}

The QSV version of the Cobra ODE is fully compatible with all software updates, but does not support older PATA/SATA FAT consoles or 2k/2k1 series SLIM consoles.\n\nThe Cobra ODE QSV offers incredible value to newer console owners, being considerably lower in price than the regular Cobra ODE.\n\nSince many owners do not require the USB cables included in the full Cobra ODE pack, the QSV package does not include the USB cables, nor does it include the power cables required for FAT consoles or the additional FFC cables required for FAT PATA and SATA CECHx/2k/2k1, since these consoles are not supported on the Cobra ODE QSV. The overall RRP has been considerably lowered as a result.\n\nWe now therefore offer two packages, the regular Cobra ODE, supporting almost all console revisions (PATA/SATA FAT **excluding BMD-21 BD drive control boards, SATA SLIM and Super SLIM consoles) and the new Cobra ODE QSV which supports only 2k5/3k SLIM and 4k/4k2 SUPER SLIM consoles.\n\nEnjoy Cobra ODE on later model consoles at a lower price and have peace of mind that the QSV is fully compatible with the regular software and hardware updates!", "title": "Cobra ODE QSV", "brand": null, "price": null, "categories": ["Accessories", "Memory", "PlayStation 3", "Video Games"]}
