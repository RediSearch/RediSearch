## Overview

RediSearch is a [Redis module](https://redis.io/modules) that provides querying, secondary indexing, and full-text search for Redis. To use RediSearch, you first declare indexes on your Redis data. You can then use the RediSearch query language to query that data.

RediSearch uses compressed, inverted indexes for fast indexing with a low memory footprint.

RediSearch indexes enhance Redis by providing exact-phrase matching, fuzzy search, and numeric filtering, among many other features.

## Getting started

If you're just getting started with RediSearch, check out the [official RediSearch tutorial](https://github.com/RediSearch/redisearch-getting-started). Also, consider viewing our [RediSearch video explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B10nHEdW3NA).

## Documentation

The [RediSearch documentation](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/) provides a complete overview of RediSearch. Helpful sections include:

* The [RediSearch quick start](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/get-started/document-database/)
* The [RediSearch command reference](https://redis.io/commands/?group=search)
* References on features such as [aggregations](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/search/aggregations/), [highlights](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/highlight/), [stemming](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/stemming/), and [spelling correction](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/spellcheck/).

## Cluster support

RediSearch has a distributed cluster version that scales to billions of documents across hundreds of servers. At the moment, distributed RediSearch is available as part of [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/) and [Redis Enterprise Software](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/overview/).

See [RediSearch on Redis Enterprise](https://redis.com/modules/redisearch/) for more information.
