# RediSearch - Redis Powered Search Engine

RediSearch is a Full-Text search over Redis, developed by RedisLabs. 

The source code is available at [https://github.com/RedisLabsModules/RediSearch](https://github.com/RedisLabsModules/RediSearch).

### Latest Release: [0.18 (Preview)](https://github.com/RedisLabsModules/RediSearch/releases/tag/v0.18)

## Overview

Redisearch impements a search engine on top of redis, but unlike other redis 
search libraries, it does not use internal data structures like sorted sets.

This also enables more advanced features, like exact phrase matching and numeric filtering for text queries, 
that are not possible or efficient with traditional redis search approache

## Client Libraries

* Limiting searches to specific document fields (up to 8 fields supported).
* Numeric filters and ranges.
* Geo filtering using Redis' own Geo-commands. 
* Supports any utf-8 encoded text.
* Retrieve full document content or just ids
