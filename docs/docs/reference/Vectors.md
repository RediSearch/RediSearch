# Vector Fields

Vector fields offers the ability to use vector similarity queries in the `FT.SEARCH` command.

Vector Similarity search capability offers the ability to load, index and query vectors stored as fields in a redis hashes. 

At present, the key functionalites offered are:

* Realtime vector indexing supporting 2 Indexing Methods -

    * FLAT - Brute-force index.

    * HNSW - Modified version of [nmslib/hnswlib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib) which is the author's implementation of [Efficient and robust approximate nearest neighbor search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1603/1603.09320.pdf).

* Realtime vector update/delete - triggering update of the index.

* K nearest neighbors queries supporting 3 distance metrics to measure the degree of similarity between vectors. Metrics:

    * L2 - Euclidean distance between two vectors.

    * IP - Internal product of two vectors.

    * COSINE - Cosine similarity of two vectors.

## Creating a vector field

Vector fields can be added to the schema in FT.CREATE with the following syntax:

```
FT.CREATE ... SCHEMA ... {field_name} VECTOR {algorithm} {count} [{attribute_name} {attribute_value} ...]
```

* `{algorithm}`

    Must be specified and be a supported vector similarity index algorithm. the supported algorithms are:

    **FLAT** - brute force algorithm.

    **HNSW** - Hierarchical Navigable Small World algorithm.

    The `algorithm` attribute specify which algorithm to use when searching for the k most similar vectors in the index.

* `{count}`

    Specify the number of attributes for the index. Must be specified.

    Notice that this attribute counts the total number of attributes passed for the index in the command,
    although algorithm parameters should be submitted as named arguments. For example:

    ```
    FT.CREATE my_idx SCHEMA vec_field VECTOR FLAT 6 TYPE FLOAT32 DIM 128 DISTANCE_METRIC L2
    ```

    Here we pass 3 parameters for the index (TYPE, DIM, DISTANCE_METRIC), and `count` counts the total number of attributes (6).

* `{attribute_name} {attribute_value}`

    Algorithm attributes for the creation of the vector index. Every algorithm has its own mandatory and optional attributes.

## Specific creation attributes per algorithm

### FLAT

* **Mandatory parameters**

    * **TYPE** - 
        Vector type. Current supported type is `FLOAT32`.
    
    * **DIM** - 
        Vector dimention. should be positive integer.
    
    * **DISTANCE_METRIC** - 
        Supported distance metric. Currently one of **{`L2`, `IP`, `COSINE`}**

* **Optional parameters**

    * **INITIAL_CAP** - 
        Initial vector capacity in the index. Effects memory allocation size of the index.

    * **BLOCK_SIZE** - 
        block size to hold `BLOCK_SIZE` amount of vectors in a contiguous array.
        This is useful when the index is dynamic with respect to addition and deletion.
        Defaults to 1048576 (1024*1024).

* Example

    ```
    FT.CREATE my_index1 
    SCHEMA vector_field VECTOR 
    FLAT 
    10 
    TYPE FLOAT32 
    DIM 128 
    DISTANCE_METRIC L2 
    INITIAL_CAP 1000000 
    BLOCK_SIZE 1000
    ```

### HNSW

* **Mandatory parameters**

    * **TYPE** - 
        Vector type. Current supported type is `FLOAT32`.
    
    * **DIM** - 
        Vector dimention. should be positive integer.
    
    * **DISTANCE_METRIC** - 
        Supported distance metric. Currently one of **{`L2`, `IP`, `COSINE`}**

* **Optional parameters**

    * **INITIAL_CAP** - 
        Initial vector capacity in the index. Effects memory allocation size of the index.

    * **M** - 
        Number the maximal allowed outgoing edges for each node in the graph in each layer. on layer zero the maximal number of outgoing edges will be `2M`. Defaults to 16.

    * **EF_CONSTRUCTION** - 
        Number the maximal allowed potential outgoing edges candidates for each node in the graph, during the graph building. Defaults to 200.

    * **EF_RUNTIME** - 
        The number of maximum top candidates to hold during the KNN search. Higher values of `EF_RUNTIME` will lead to a more accurate results on the expense of a longer runtime. Defaults to 10.

* Example

    ```
    FT.CREATE my_index2 
    SCHEMA vector_field VECTOR 
    HNSW 
    14 
    TYPE FLOAT32 
    DIM 128 
    DISTANCE_METRIC L2 
    INITIAL_CAP 1000000 
    M 40 
    EF_CONSTRUCTION 250 
    EF_RUNTIME 20
    ```

## Querying vector fields

We allow using vector similarity queries in the `FT.SEARCH` "query" parameter. The syntax for vector similarity queries is `*=>[{vector similarity query}]` for running the query on an entire vector field, or `{primary filter query}=>[{vector similarity query}]` for running similarity query on the result of the primary filter query. To use a vector similarity query, you must specify the option `DIALECT 2` in the command itself, or by setting the `DEFAULT_DIALECT` option to `2`, either with the command`FT.CONFIG SET` or when loading the `redisearch` module and passing it the argument `DEFAULT_DIALECT 2`.

As of version 2.4, we allow vector similarity to be used **once** in the query, and over the entire query filter.

* Invalid example: `"(@title:Matrix)=>[KNN 10 @v $B] @year:[2020 2022]"`

* Valid example: `"(@title:Matrix @year:[2020 2022])=>[KNN 10 @v $B]"`

The `{vector similarity query}` part inside the square brackets needs to be in the following format:

    KNN { number | $number_attribute } @{vector field} $blob_attribute [{vector query param name} {value|$value_attribute} [...]] [ AS {score field name | $score_field_name_attribute}]

Every "`*_attribute`" parameter should refer to an attribute in the [`PARAMS`](/commands/ft.search) section.

*   `{ number | $number_attribute }` - The number of requested results ("K").

*   `@{vector field}` - `vector field` should be a name of a vector field in the index.

*   `$blob_attribute` - An attribute that holds the query vector as blob. must be passed through the `PARAMS` section.

*   `[{vector query param name} {value|$value_attribute} [...]]` - An optional part for passing vector similarity query parameters. Parameters should come in key-value pairs and should be valid parameters for the query. see what [runtime parameters](/redisearch/reference/vectors#specific-runtime-attributes-per-algorithm) are valid for each algorithm.

*   `[ AS {score field name | $score_field_name_attribute}]` - An optional part for specifying a score field name, for later sorting by the similarity score. By default the score field name is "`__{vector field}_score`" and it can be used for sorting without using `AS {score field name}` in the query.

### Hybrid Queries

We refer to vector similarity queries of the form `{primary filter query}=>[{vector similarity query}]` as *hybrid queries*. RediSearch has an internal mechanism for optimizing the computation of such queries. There are 2 modes in which hybrid queries are executed: 
1. **Batches mode** - In this mode, a batch of the high-scoring documents from the vector index are retrieved. These documents are returned ONLY if `{primary filter query}` is satisfied. (i.e., the document contains a similar vector and meets the filter criteria). The procedure terminates when `k` documents that pass the `{primary filter query}` are returned or after every vector in the index was obtained and processed.
    
    The **Batch size** is determined by a heuristics that is based on `k`, and the ratio between the expected number of documents in the index that pass the `{primary filter query}` and the vector index size. The goal of the aforementioned heuristics is to minimize the total number of batches required to get the `k` results, while preserving a small batch size as possible. Note that the batch size may change *dynamically* in each iteration, based on the number of results that passed the filter in previous batches.
2. **Ad-hoc brute-force mode** - in general, this approach is preferable when the number of documents that pass the `{primary filter query}` part of the query is relatively small. Here, the score of *every* vector which corresponds to a document that passes the filter is computed, and the top `k` results are selected and returned. Note that the results of the KNN query will *always be accurate* in this mode, even if the underline vector index algorithm is an approximate one.

The specific execution mode of a hybrid query is determined by a heuristics that aims to minimize the query runtime, and is based on several factors that derive from the query and the index. Moreover, the execution mode may change from *batches* to *ad-hoc BF* during the run, based on estimations of some relevant factors, that are being updated from one batch to another.  

## Runtime attributes

###Hybrid query attributes

The following **optional** attributes allow overriding the default auto-selected policy in which a hybrid query is executed:

* **HYBRID_POLICY** - the policy to run the hybrid query in. Possible values are *BATCHES* and *ADHOC_BF* (not case-sensitive). Note that the *batch size* will be auto selected dynamically in *BATCHES* mode, unless *BATCH_SIZE* attribute is given as well.
* **BATCH_SIZE** - a fixed batch size to use in *every iteration*, when *BATCHES* policy is auto-selected or requested.

###Algorithm specific attributes
### FLAT

Currently there are no runtime parameters available for FLAT indexes.

### HNSW

* **Optional parameters**

    * **EF_RUNTIME** - 
        The number of maximum top candidates to hold during the KNN search. Higher values of `EF_RUNTIME` will lead to a more accurate results on the expense of a longer runtime. Defaults to the `EF_RUNTIME` value passed on creation (which defaults to 10).

### A few notes

1. Although specifying `K` requested results, the default `LIMIT` in RediSearch is 10, so for getting all the returned results, make sure to specify `LIMIT 0 {K}` in your command.

2. By default, the results are sorted by their documents RediSearch score. If you would like to sort by vector similarity score, use `SORTBY {score field name}`. See examples below.
