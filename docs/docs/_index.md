RediSearch is a [source-available](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/master/LICENSE.txt) Redis module that enables querying, secondary indexing, and full-text search for Redis. These features enable multi-field queries, [aggregation](/docs/stack/search/reference/aggregations), exact phrase matching, [numeric filtering](/docs/stack/search/reference/query_syntax/#numeric-filters-in-query), [geo filtering](/docs/stack/search/reference/query_syntax/#geo-filters-in-query) and [vector similarity semantic search](/docs/stack/search/reference/query_syntax/#vector-similarity-search-in-query) on top of text queries.

* Full-text indexing of multiple fields in a document
* Incremental indexing without performance loss
* Document ranking (provided manually by the user at index time)
* Boolean queries with AND, OR, NOT operators between subqueries
* Optional query clauses
* [Prefix-based searches](/docs/stack/search/reference/query_syntax/#prefix-matching)
* Field weights
* [Auto-complete](/docs/stack/search/design/overview/#auto-completion) suggestions (with fuzzy prefix suggestions)
* Exact phrase search and slop-based search
* [Stemming](/docs/stack/search/reference/stemming)-based query expansion for [many languages](/docs/stack/search/reference/stemming/#supported-languages) (using [Snowball](http://snowballstem.org/))
* Support for custom functions for query expansion and scoring (see [Extensions](/docs/stack/search/reference/extensions))
* [Numeric filters](/docs/stack/search/reference/query_syntax/#numeric-filters-in-query) and ranges
* [Geofiltering](/docs/stack/search/reference/query_syntax/#geo-filters-in-query) using Redis [geo commands](/commands/?group=geo)
* [Vector similarity search](/docs/stack/search/reference/query_syntax/#vector-similarity-search-in-query) for semantic search using exact and approximate algorithms
* Unicode support (UTF-8 input required)
* Retrieval of full document contents or only their IDs
* Document deletion and updating with index garbage collection

For more information about RediSearch features, see the [feature reference](/docs/stack/search/reference) pages.

## JSON documents

When combined with the [RedisJSON](/docs/stack/json) module, which is included with Redis Stack, RediSearch can index and query JSON documents.

To learn how to use RediSearch with JSON documents, see [Indexing JSON documents](/docs/stack/search/indexing_json).

## Client libraries

Official and community client libraries are available for Python, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, C#, and PHP.

See the [clients page](clients) for the full list.

## Cluster support

RediSearch provides a distributed cluster version that scales to billions of documents and hundreds of servers.

## Commercial support

Commercial support for RediSearch is provided by Redis Ltd. See the [Redis Ltd. website](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/technology/redis-search/#sds) for more details and contact information.

## Supported platforms
RediSearch is developed and tested on Linux and macOS on x86_64 CPUs.
