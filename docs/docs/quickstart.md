Make sure that you have [Redis Stack installed](/docs/getting-started/install-stack/) and running. Alternatively, you can [create a free Redis Cloud account](https://redis.com/try-free/), which includes access to all Redis Stack features.

## Overview

This quick start guide will demonstrate how to:

* Create a secondary index.
* Load [JSON](/docs/stack/json/) data into Redis.
* Perform simple searches on the indexed data.

The data is a simple bicycle inventory consisting of a JSON array, where each element has the following structure:

```json
{
  "brand": "brand name",
  "condition": "new | used | refurbished",
  "description": "description",
  "model": "model",
  "price": 0
}
```

## Connect to Redis Stack

{{< clients-example search_quickstart connect >}}
> redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379
{{< /clients-example>}}

## Create an index

The Redis keyspace is unstructured and flat. As such, you can only access data by primary key (keyname), making it cumbersome to find a document based on a secondary characteristic, such as finding a school by name or listing all schools in a particular city. Redis Stack addresses this need by providing the ability to add secondary indexes to your data. Redis currently supports secondary index creation for the [HASH](/docs/data-types/hashes) and [JSON](/docs/stack/json) data types.

Use the following `FT.CREATE` command to create an index with fields and weights, where the default weight is 1.0. Note how each term of the `SCHEMA` is an element of a JSON object, identified by its [JSONPath](/docs/data-types/json/path/).

{{< clients-example search_quickstart create_index >}}
> FT.CREATE idx:bicycle ON JSON PREFIX 1 bicycle: SCORE 1.0 SCHEMA $.brand AS brand TEXT WEIGHT 1.0 $.model AS model TEXT WEIGHT 1.0 $.description AS description TEXT WEIGHT 1.0 $.price AS price NUMERIC $.condition AS condition TAG SEPARATOR ,
OK
{{< / clients-example >}}

Any pre-existing JSON documents that have a key prefixed with `bicycle:` are automatically added to the index after it is created. Additionally, any JSON documents with the same prefix that are created or modified after index creation are also added or re-added to the index.

## Add JSON documents

Use the `JSON.SET` command to create new JSON documents.

{{< clients-example search_quickstart add_documents "" 2 >}}

### Single-term query

Use the following command to perform a simple single-term query, such as finding all bicycles with a specific model:

{{< clients-example search_quickstart query_single_term >}}
> FT.SEARCH "idx:bicycle" "@model:Jigger" LIMIT 0 10
1) (integer) 1
2) "bicycle:0"
3) 1) "$"
   2) "{\"brand\":\"Velorim\",\"model\":\"Jigger\",\"price\":270,\"description\":\"Small and powerful, the Jigger is the best ride for the smallest of tikes!

{{< / clients-example >}}

### Exact match query

Use the following command to perform an exact match query, such as finding all bicycles with the brand name `Noka Bikes`. Note the use double quotes around the search term.

{{< clients-example search_quickstart query_exact_matching >}}
> FT.SEARCH "idx:bicycle" "@brand:\"Noka Bikes\"" LIMIT 0 10
1) (integer) 1
2) "bicycle:4"
3) 1) "$"
   2) "{\"brand\":\"Noka Bikes\",\"model\":\"Kahuna\",\"price\":3200,\"description\":\"Whether you want to try your hand at XC racing or are looking for a lively trail bike that's just as inspiring on the climbs as it is over rougher ground, the Wilder is one heck of a bike built specifically for short women.
