     * 3. We add a state check job for each priority.
     * 4. Add a final job to release the other waiting thread (low priority job)
     * 5. Release one of the threads from the waiting job to execute the rest of the jobs.
     *
     * We expect that the unblocked thread will understand that it should be high priority biased and will take the high priority
     * jobs before the low priority jobs. therefore, the high priority state check is expected to see 5 high priority jobs
     * and 0 low priority jobs, and the low priority state check is expected to see 5 high priority jobs and 5 low priority jobs.
     *
     * Before the mechanism fix, the unblocked thread would assume it is unbiased because it sees there is one running thread
     * (num jobs in progress is not smaller than the high priority bias number), and would take a high priority job and
     * a low priority job alternately, and we would get to both state checks after executing all the count jobs.
